I am Patrick Corr. I have been a trader most of my career. I currently trade equitiers, futures, options and crypto.
I would like to continue trading but use the skills I learn in this class to open new doors that require a more technical skill set.
I beleive that crypto, defi and web3 are the future of finance.
